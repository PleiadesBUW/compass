# Introduction to Docker

## What is Docker?
Docker is an open-source platform that enables you to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications using containerization. Containers provide a lightweight, isolated environment that packages an application with its dependencies, ensuring consistency and portability across different systems.

With Docker, you can build, ship, and run applications seamlessly across various environments, making it easier to manage and distribute software.

## How to Use Docker
Using Docker involves the following key concepts:

- **Images**: Docker images are read-only templates that contain everything needed to run an application, including the code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies.

- **Containers**: Containers are lightweight, isolated instances created from Docker images. They run applications in an isolated environment, ensuring consistency across different systems.

- **Dockerfile**: A Dockerfile is a text file that contains instructions to build a Docker image. It defines the environment, dependencies, and commands needed to create a container.

- **Docker Compose**: Docker Compose is a tool for defining and managing multi-container applications. It allows you to describe the services, networks, and volumes required for a complete application stack.

## Command Line Usage of Docker
Docker provides a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the Docker daemon. Some common Docker CLI commands include:

- `docker run`: Creates and starts a new container based on a Docker image.

- `docker build`: Builds a Docker image from a Dockerfile.

- `docker pull`: Pulls a Docker image from a Docker registry.

- `docker push`: Pushes a Docker image to a Docker registry.

- `docker stop`: Stops a running container.

- `docker rm`: Removes a container.

- `docker ps`: Lists running containers.

- `docker images`: Lists available Docker images.

## Install Docker on your personal computer

### Installing Docker on Windows
To install Docker on your personal computer running Windows, follow these steps:

1. Visit the official Docker website and download the Docker Desktop installer for Windows.

2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation process.

3. Once the installation is complete, Docker Desktop will be running, and you can access the Docker CLI through the command prompt or PowerShell.

4. To verify the installation, open a command prompt or PowerShell window and run the command `docker version`. You should see the Docker version information if the installation was successful.

5. You are now ready to use Docker on your Windows machine!

For more detailed instructions and troubleshooting, refer to the official Docker documentation.

Congratulations! You now have an overview of Docker, how to use it, its command line usage, and how to install it on your Windows computer.

### Installing Docker on macOS

To install Docker on your Apple macOS computer, follow these steps:

1. Visit the official Docker website and navigate to the Docker Desktop for Mac page.

2. Click on the "Download from Docker Hub" button to start the download.

3. Once the download is complete, open the Docker.dmg file.

4. Drag the Docker.app file to the Applications folder.

5. Open the Applications folder and double-click on the Docker.app file to launch Docker Desktop.

6. You might be prompted to authorize the installation with your system password. Enter your password to continue.

7. Docker Desktop will start and prompt you to log in with your Docker Hub account. If you don't have an account, you can create one for free.

8. After logging in, Docker Desktop will configure the necessary components and start the Docker daemon.

9. Once Docker Desktop is up and running, you should see the Docker icon in your system tray.

10. To verify the installation, open a terminal and run the command `docker version`. You should see the Docker version information if the installation was successful.

Congratulations! Docker is now installed on your macOS computer.

Note: Docker Desktop for macOS requires a compatible version of macOS. Make sure to check the Docker documentation for any specific system requirements or compatibility issues.

### Example
To get you started, a simple example can be how to `pull` and `run` the `hello-world` image from Docker hub.

* Open a terminal or command prompt.

* Pull the "hello-world" image from Docker Hub by running the following command:

````````
$ docker pull hello-world
````````

This command will download the latest version of the **hello-world** image to your local machine.

* Once the image is downloaded, run the Docker container using the following command:

````````
$ docker run hello-world
````````

Docker will create a container from the "hello-world" image and execute it. You should see an output message **"Hello from Docker!"** confirming that Docker is working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker completed the following steps:
 
 1. The Docker client communicated with the Docker daemon.
 
 2. The Docker daemon retrieved the 'hello-world' image from the Docker Hub repository. (amd64)
 
 3. Using the downloaded image, the Docker daemon created a new container that executed the program responsible for generating the output you are currently viewing.
 
 4. The Docker daemon streamed the resulting output to the Docker client, which then forwarded it to your terminal.

That's it! You have successfully pulled and run the "hello-world" Docker image. Feel free to explore more Docker images and containers to enhance your containerization experience.
