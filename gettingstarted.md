## Getting Started
Welcome to the Compass lab! To make the most of your time here, it's essential to familiarize yourself with the Linux operating system and understand the basics of command-line usage. This page will guide you through the initial steps, helping you gain access to the computers and providing resources to learn about the command line.

## 1. Accessing the Computers
To begin using the COMPASS lab, you need to obtain access. You can do do by following the steps given here:

It enables you to execute commands, manage files, and control various aspects of the computer system. If you are new to the command line or need a refresher, the following resource will be helpful:
