## Getting Started: Access
### Getting an account
In general you will receive a compass account when you register as a student, at the beginning of the semester.

If you have not beem assigned a compass account in the way mentioned above, please send an email to:

**haeusling{at}uni-wuppertal.de**

It is highly recommended to change your password to a  personal password of sufficient 
as soon as possible (a week ideally). This can be done by going to your terminal and entering the 

```bash
$ passwd
```

command. 

After entering this command, you can enter a password and press enter.


### Questions/Support
In case of questions and problems, we advice to first ask your professor or teaching assistant, as often times they have 
sufficient knowledge about compass to assist in simple matters, if that is not sufficient please feel free to ask for additional help 
or support at:

**haeusling{at}uni-wuppertal.de**


### Remote login
You can access compass computers without being in the lab! Think of each computer as a server which can be accessed remotely. To do this
you need to know your username and password for compass lab and know the IP address of a compass computer. To access compass computers 
remotely, on your personal computer open a command prompt by going to your windows search bar and entering "CMD". This will open a terminal.

Here, you can use a ssh (Secure Shell Protocol) to access a particular compass computer. The command will look something like:

```bash
$ ssh username@compass22.uni-wuppertal.de
```
You can replace "compass22" with any valid computer ID. When you log in, you are accessing your account on the compass computer, hence don't 
worry your friend and you can access the same computer if you want, it is not one user at a time per computer.
